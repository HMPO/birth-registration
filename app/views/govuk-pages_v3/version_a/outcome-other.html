      <p class="govuk-body">One parent can complete the registration online, including ordering birth certificates.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your identity will be checked by GOV.UK One Login. This works in a similar way to Government Gateway.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to take the child.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re registering both parents, you’ll need proof that they both agree that they are the child’s parents.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get birth certificates at the appointment. Each birth certificate costs £12.50.</p>
