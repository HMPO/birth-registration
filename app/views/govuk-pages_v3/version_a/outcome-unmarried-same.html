      <p class="govuk-body">In UK legislation, same-sex female parents be registered as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the Mother (the person who gave birth to the child)</li>
        <li>the Parent (the Mother’s female partner)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Parents must have received fertility treatment as a couple at a licensed UK clinic. You do not need to show evidence.</p>
      <p>Birth mother needs to start the registration online, and will be given a unique link to share with father or second parent.</p>
      <p>Both parents' identity will be checked by GOV.UK One Login. This works in a similar way to Government Gateway.</p>
      <p>After you submit the form, a registrar at the council will complete the official registration.</p>
      <p>Birth certificates will be sent by post. They cost £12.50 each (standard delivery).</p>
      <p>The mother starts the online process to register a birth, and invites the father or parent to joint the registration.</p>
      <p>Both parents will need to add their details separately.</p>
      <p>Identity is checked by GOV.UK One Login, which works in a similar way to Government Gateway.</p>
